        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Jeremiah Priddy and I am currently attending the University of California, Riverside.  I am a third year and I am majoring in Media and Cultural Studies.  I live in Corona, CA which is the next city over about 25 minutes away.  I have commuted and I have also lived on campus during my 3 years but commuting has worked out better for me in terms of saving money.  I also play baseball at UCR.  Unfortunately, I injured my arm when I was out in Canada playing summer ball.  I had to acquire surgery because of it and the recovery process is a year long so I will have to use a medical redshirt and miss this year.  I wish I could be out there with my teammates but I also have to do what is best for me and my baseball career.  Some other hobbies I enjoy is hanging out with friends, playing video games, and watching sports.  When it comes to football I am one of the biggest Cowboys fans out there and I also have a wide knowledge of the game itself.  I can also say that about baseball, basketball, and soccer.<br><br>

        Another thing I really enjoy is traveling and just experiencing new places.  Me and a group of buddies took a weekend trip to Seattle last year to watch a football game and it was such a fun experience.  We enjoyed the city the couple days we were there before the football game and then the game itself was unforgettable.  Another thing with being part of the baseball team is we would travel to many different places to play different teams and that was always fun to do.  Including some long bus rides with your good friends I always enjoyed traveling.  Some of the places I got to experience that I didnâ€™t think I would get to for awhile was San Francisco, New Orleans, Albuquerque, and Davis.  All great places that I would definitely go to again.
<br><br>

        When it comes to me as a person I like to think of myself as more of a laid back type of guy that likes to look at the good things in life.  I live in the moment and do not know what I am even going to eat for breakfast tomorrow morning.  When it comes to life in general I have no clue what I want to do with it.  I just kind of go with the flow.  I am majoring in Media and Cultural Studies but I really do not know what I am going to do with it yet.  I really enjoy media and Iâ€™m just going to have to see where it takes me.
